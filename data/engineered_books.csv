The Warren Buffett Way: 3rd Edition,Robert Hagstrom,72.0,1005.0,72.0,1005,"Warren Buffett remains one of the most sought-after and watched figures in business today. He has become a billionaire and investment sage by buying chunks of companies and holding onto them, managing them as businesses, and eventually reaping huge profits for himself and investors in Berkshire Hathaway. The first two editions of The Warren Buffett Way gave investors their first in-depth look at the innovative investment and business strategies behind the spectacular success of living legend Warren E. Buffett. Tracing Warren Buffett's career from the beginning, Hagstrom told listeners exactly how, starting with an initial investment of only $100 Buffett built a business empire and has an estimated net worth of $44 billion. The Third Edition of The Warren Buffett Way will focus on the timeless principles and strategies behind Buffett's extraordinary investment success. There will be new chapters on the important distinctions between investment and trading and an examination of the most successful disciples of Warren Buffett. Some less important material will be deleted and the overall focus will be to create an edition that will stand the test of time, distilling Buffett's success formula in a way that will provide value to listeners for decades to come.",10 hours and 31 minutes,",#17 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Business Careers,#1 in Biographies of Business Leaders,#3 in Personal Finance",4.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4947429364311992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084066763515466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36441351206504735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318069945620362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5053229035034189,0.0,0.0,0.09919222563356456,0.0,0.17534565084408327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46261001452732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,302.40000000000003,239.28571428571428

His unique approach - thematic rather than verse-by-verse - makes the ancient treatise eminently accessible.In a world that seems spellbound by argument over dialogue, vi-vaad over sam-vaad, Devdutt highlights how Krishna nudges Arjuna to understand rather than judge his relationships. This becomes relevant today when we are increasingly indulging and isolating the self (self-improvement, self-actualization, self-realization - even selfies!) We forget that we live in an ecosystem of others, where we can nourish each other with food, love and meaning, even when we fight.

The Bhagavad Gita,Eknath Easwaran,1988.0,280.0,2021.0,280,"The Bhagavad Gita, ""The Song of the Lord"", is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Easwaran's reliable and accessible version has consistently been the best-selling translation. Easwaran's introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems - it's not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. ""The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita's subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage"" to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile. This audio recording is a complete and unabridged reading of Eknath Easwaran's book The Bhagavad Gita. ",-1,-1,4.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23652358842948376,0.0,0.0,0.1890062631193073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24135236634304033,0.0,0.2524980423698323,0.0,0.0,0.2563531082895153,0.0,0.0,0.5526524204914401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3635885049345323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26271490874770675,0.0,0.23429734833166085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793160693899366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28470501614803556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1,1,9343.6,59.57446808510638

Outliers: The Story of Success,Malcolm Gladwell,4439.0,500.0,4459.0,500,"In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers"" - the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

Flow: Living at the Peak of Your Abilities,Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi Ph.D.,,1439.0,,1439,"In flow, everyday experience becomes a moment by moment opportunity for joy and self-fulfillment. Flow is the brain-child of a fascinating psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a renowned social scientist who has devoted his life's work to the study of what makes people truly happy, satisfied and fulfilled. While much of the study of psychology investigates disorders of the human mind, Dr. Csikszentmihalyi takes a different route. He focuses on the noble side of human nature, our capacity for living a life of integrity, courage, and perseverance. With his landmark research on flow, he reveals what he considers beautiful in life, ways of being and behaving that make people happy, satisfied and delighted to be alive. His insights into the ""flow experience"" show ways to lessen stress, fear and anxiety while increasing feelings of challenge, joy and excitement. The revolutionary findings of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Experience Sampling Method offer unprecedented information about the specific ways we can turn life into a continuous high quality experience. You'll discover how anyone can enrich his or her quality of life simply by learning how flow occurs and what it feels like. You'll learn about the key elements of the flow experience including: ",5 hours and 31 minutes,",#180 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#2 in Creativity & Genius,#46 in Personal Success,#592 in Personal Development & Self-Help",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40471043719973787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19647444896310595,0.7175067223422851,0.19468366612213361,0.0,0.0,0.09890796463412603,0.0,0.20678847783242213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345854939756827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20737697757519682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724079935802854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,-0.0,-1439.0

Badi Soch Ka Bada Jadu [The Magic of Thinking Big],David Schwartz,805.0,836.0,806.0,836,"Badi Shoch Ka Bada Jadu is the Hindi translation of David J. Schwartz's best seller The Magic of Thinking Big. The author’s point of view is that thinking big is the way to success, that is, thinking positively about oneself. The main stumbling block that prevents many people from succeeding in their life is the smallness or inconsequential nature of their thoughts. Schwartz tries to prove that it is not necessary to have an inherent talent or be an intellectual for attaining success, but there is a need for a person to understand and learn the habit of behaving and thinking in ways by which he or she can reach the top. His book begins with the story of a salesman who is able to sell more, and make more money than his co-salesmen. He is not highly qualified, influential, or smarter than his friends. However, he just decides that he should sell more and eventually he achieves what he wants.",11 hours and 31 minutes,",#275 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#59 in Personal Success,#813 in Personal Development & Self-Help",4.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616292897560668,0.1412351059074908,0.0,0.0,0.2257222610741252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15025778645466842,0.0,0.0,0.29725451123279684,0.21710925892063676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14964204678781814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15285365607908177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616292897560668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3137494083091959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27524427924807143,0.5851724637009408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678551081465559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,3622.5,185.77777777777777

The Arts of Seduction,Seema Anand,82.0,668.0,82.0,668,"The Arts of Seduction is a guide to having great sex in the 21st century. It seeks to make what has been largely reduced to an act of instant gratification a rather more pleasurable experience. Drawing inspiration from the Kama Sutra, whose groundbreaking attitudes towards sex remain relevant thousands of years after it was first composed, the book delves into numerous techniques and refinements that elevate sex to an altogether different level - whether it is innovative codes for love messages, the effects of applying perfume to different parts of the body, the many different types of kissing, where and how to massage your lover’s feet or what kind of jewellery to wear during lovemaking. Accessible, sensuous and full of surprises, The Arts of Seduction will forever change the way you think about love and lovemaking.",-1,-1,4.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35505876307472783,0.2338081982629745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32592404204011943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30862358249907784,0.29856239147774144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5958864525498312,0.1550025999976754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2774503495280616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26938325103450267,0.0,-1,1,344.40000000000003,159.04761904761904

Other than retelling the interesting parts of the Mahabharata, what makes this book a favourite among audiences is Pattanaik's rendering of the various local folklores and tales that are associated with the epic, which have been presented in a whole new genre. With a master stroke, the author has elaborated the storyline by including lesser-known folklore stories of the epic, while keeping intact its original form and style. ",8 hours and 43 minutes,",#110 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in History of Religion (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Ancient & Classical Literature Collections,#2 in Fairy Tale Fantasy",4.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084579473338021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7047991569433508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574420180397858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4567881974957806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,5994.0,195.33333333333334

The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement - 30th Anniversary Edition,Eliyahu M. Goldratt,1566.0,937.0,1586.0,937,"In this intriguing business novel, which illustrates state-of-the-art economic theory, Alex Rogo is a UniCo plant manager whose factory and marriage are failing. To revitalize the plant, he follows piecemeal advice from an elusive former college professor who teaches, for example, that reduction in the efficiency of some plant operations may make the entire operation more productive. Alex's attempts to find the path to profitability and to engage his employees in the struggle involve the listener; and thankfully the authors' economic models, including a game with matchsticks and bowls, are easy to understand. Although some characters are as anonymous as the goods manufactured in the factory, others ring true. In addition, the tender story of Alex and his wife's separation and reconciliation makes a touching contrast to the rest of the book.

[was the] greatest crime in all history . He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost 35 million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British in famines, epidemics, communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919. Besides the deaths of Indians, British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country, in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire, India's share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent.

The Forest of Enchantments,Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni,594.0,836.0,596.0,836,"The Ramayana, one of the world's greatest epics, is also a tragic love story. In this brilliant retelling, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni places Sita at the centre of the novel: this is Sita's version. The Forest of Enchantments is also a very human story of some of the other women in the epic, often misunderstood and relegated to the margins: Kaikeyi, Surpanakha, Mandodari. A powerful comment on duty, betrayal, infidelity and honour, it is also about women's struggle to retain autonomy in a world that privileges men, as Chitra transforms an ancient story into a gripping, contemporary battle of wills. While the Ramayana resonates even today, she makes it more relevant than ever, in the underlying questions in the novel: How should women be treated by their loved ones? What are their rights in a relationship?

7 Secrets of Shiva: The Hindu Trinity Series,Devdutt Pattanaik,686.0,501.0,687.0,501,"Shiva, 'the destroyer' among the Hindu trinity (of gods), is depicted in many contradictory manners. He is an ascetic who wears animal skin, his body smeared with ashes. Contradictory to his wild nature, he is also depicted as having a family, with a beautiful wife and two children. There are many more such varied representations of Shiva, the most prominent of these being the Linga and the Nataraja. The author, Devdutt Pattanaik, introduces listeners to these varied aspects and representations, and then sets about interpreting them. He explains the different anomalies and conflicts in beliefs, as well as the symbolism, rituals and reasons behind Hindu worship.

From puberty to marriage, from pregnancy to menopause, Rujuta explains in detail the changes women go through (and, God knows, as Indian women, we go through way beyond those just hormonal - husband, in-laws, children, career, etc) and how what we do (or don't) during these phases affects our overall well-being. Building on her four principles of eating right from Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight, she goes on to share her four strategies (Nutrition, Exercise, Sleep and Relationships) for each of these phases and especially the lifestyle disorders of Pcod, hypothyroid and diabetes. Rujuta, in her usual indomitable style, debunks (rubbishes rather) myths related to food, hormones and workouts; forces us to rethink our belief that pregnancy, menopause, hypothyroid, etc, come in the way of losing weight; and reveals just how easy it is to remain healthy, strong and fit through one's life.

The Silk Roads: A New History of the World,Peter Frankopan,1775.0,1338.0,1793.0,1338,"The sun is setting on the Western world. Slowly but surely, the direction in which the world spins has reversed: where for the last five centuries the globe turned westward on its axis, it now turns to the east.... For centuries fame and fortune were to be found in the West - in the New World of the Americas. Today it is the East that calls out to those in search of adventure and riches. The region stretching from Eastern Europe and sweeping right across Central Asia, deep into China and India, is taking center stage in international politics, commerce, and culture - and is shaping the modern world. This region, the true center of the Earth, is obscure to many in the English-speaking world. Yet this is where civilization itself began, where the world's great religions were born and took root. The Silk Roads were no exotic series of connections but networks that linked continents and oceans together. Along them flowed ideas, goods, disease, and death. This was where empires were won - and where they were lost. As a new era emerges, the patterns of exchange are mirroring those that have criss-crossed Asia for millennia. The Silk Roads are rising again. A major reassessment of world history, The Silk Roads is an important account of the forces that have shaped the global economy and the political renaissance in the reemerging East.

Autobiography of a Yogi,Paramhansa Yogananda,,702.0,,702,"This audiobook, the version of which was first published in 1946, helped launch a spiritual revolution in the West. Only rarely does a sage of Paramhansa Yogananda's stature write a firsthand account of his life experiences.

Yayaati,Vishnu Sakharam Khandekar,120.0,1003.0,120.0,1003,"The story of Yayati is perhaps one of the most intriguing and fascinating episodes of Mahabharata. Yayati was a great scholar and one of the noblest rulers of olden times. He followed the shastras and was devoted to the welfare of his subjects.

Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind,Joe Dispenza D.C.,530.0,1172.0,534.0,1172,"Joe Dispenza, DC, has spent decades studying the human mind - how it works, how it stores information, and why it perpetuates the same behavioral patterns over and over. In the acclaimed film What the Bleep Do We Know!?, he began to explain how the brain evolves - by learning new skills, developing the ability to concentrate in the midst of chaos, and even healing the body and the psyche. Evolve Your Brain presents this information in depth, while helping you take control of your mind, explaining how thoughts can create chemical reactions that keep you addicted to patterns and feelings - including ones that make you unhappy. And when you know how these bad habits are created, it's possible to not only break these patterns, but also reprogram and evolve your brain, so that new, positive, and beneficial habits can take over.

Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,Joshua Foer,1241.0,683.0,1247.0,683,"The unabridged, downloadable audiobook edition of Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything, Joshua Foer's part-memoir, part-guide on mastering your memory. Read by Mike Chamberlain. On average, people squander forty days annually trying to remember things they’ve forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. He also discovered a truth we too often forget: In every way, we are the sum of our memories.

The Universe Has Your Back: Transform Fear into Faith,Gabrielle Bernstein,2529.0,586.0,2560.0,586,"In her latest book, The Universe Has Your Back, New York Times best-selling author Gabrielle Bernstein teaches listeners how to transform their fear into faith in order to live a divinely guided life. Each story and lesson in the book guides listeners to release the blocks to what they most long for: happiness, security, and clear direction. The lessons help listeners relinquish the need to control so they can relax into a sense of certainty and freedom. Listeners will learn to stop chasing life and truly live.

The interrogation, which was done by the army and police, included torture of the worst kind imaginable. Many of his comrades went insane or ended their own lives.

The Silva Ultramind ESP System,Michael Wickett,,1774.0,,1774,"Unleash the telepathic powers you were born with! Skeptical? I was, until I proved it to myself. You see, telepathic powers exist in all of us; they are part of the natural way we communicate with each other. Your brain beats at various frequencies, much like your heart. Usually your brain beats at 14 cycles per second, the Beta frequency. Very occasionally it beats between 7 and 14 cycles per second. This frequency is known as Alpha frequency.

A man named Jose Silva perfected a simple 15-minute technique for entering the Alpha level at will, creating his own brand of ESP, which he called ""effective sensory projection"".

Caste Matters,Suraj Yengde,93.0,879.0,93.0,879,"In this explosive book, Suraj Yengde, a first-generation Dalit scholar educated across continents, challenges deep-seated beliefs about caste and unpacks its many layers. He describes his gut-wrenching experiences of growing up in a Dalit basti, the multiple humiliations suffered by Dalits on a daily basis, and their incredible resilience enabled by love and humour. As he brings to light the immovable glass ceiling that exists for Dalits even in politics, bureaucracy, and judiciary, Yengde provides an unflinchingly honest account of divisions within the Dalit community itself - from their internal caste divisions to the conduct of elite Dalits and their tokenized forms of modern-day untouchability - all operating under the inescapable influences of Brahminical doctrines.",11 hours and 12 minutes,",#283 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Religious History,#1 in Church & State,#3 in Buddhism (Audible Audiobooks & Originals)",4.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3945815487780517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5271310430534462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5028176964917948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5600112756971822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,427.79999999999995,191.08695652173915

Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes,1141.0,1338.0,1157.0,1338,"The most influential work of the entire Spanish literary canon and a founding work of modern Western literature, Don Quixote is also one of the greatest works ever written. Hugely entertaining but also moving at times, this episodic novel is built on the fantasy life of one Alonso Quixano, who lives with his niece and housekeeper in La Mancha.

Anger: Buddhist Wisdom for Cooling the Flames,Thich Nhat Hanh,654.0,615.0,663.0,615,"Thich Nhat Hanh is a holy man, for he is humble and devout. He is a scholar of immense intellectual capacity. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity' Martin Luther King, Jr, in Nobel Peace Prize nomination It was under the bodhi tree in India 2500 years ago that Buddha achieved the insight that three states of mind were the source of all our unhappiness: ignorance, obsessive desire and anger. All are equally difficult to control but, in one instant of anger, lives can be ruined, and our spiritual development can be destroyed. Twenty-five centuries after the Buddha's insight, medical science tells us that the Buddha was right: anger can also ruin our health. It is one of the most powerful emotions and one of the most difficult to change. Thich Nhat Hanh offers a fresh perspective on taking care of our anger as we would take care of a baby crying - picking it up, talking quietly to it, probing for what is making the baby cry. Laced with stories and techniques, Anger offers a wise and loving look at transforming this difficult emotion into peace and for bringing harmony and healing to all the areas and relationships in our lives that have been affected by anger.",-1,-1,4.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2950872579952375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2800833483642126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5537108819350692,0.0,0.0,0.2842023431073958,0.2934054075136464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2925819221284227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31283369231779157,0.27439316442020756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2068270353426164,0.0,0.24389598386187525,0.0,-1,1,3008.3999999999996,133.69565217391306

Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored,Rishi Kapoor,435.0,669.0,436.0,669,"Few actors in Hindi cinema have had Rishi Kapoor's sort of a career arc: from the gawky adolescent pining for his schoolteacher (Mera Naam Joker, 1970) to the naughty 90-year-old (Kapoor & Sons, 2016), Rishi Kapoor has regaled audiences for close to 50 years. He won a National Award for his debut, became an overnight sensation with his first film as a leading man (Bobby, 1973), and carved a niche for himself with a string of romantic musical blockbusters in an era known for its angst-ridden films. He was the youth icon that is still the toast of the satellite TV circuit. The songs he lip-synced are the bread and butter of all radio stations even today. Then there was the second coming after a brief hiatus in the 1990s - as one of the finest actors in mainstream Hindi cinema with powerhouse performances in films like Do Dooni Chaar, D-Day, Agneepath and others.

Or as psychotherapist Amy Morin asks, what should we avoid when we encounter adversity? Through her years counseling others and her own experiences navigating personal loss, Morin realized it is often the habits we cannot break that are holding us back from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity or agonizing over things beyond our control, obsessing over past events, resenting the achievements of others, or expecting immediate positive results all hold us back.

After film critic Gene Siskel asked her, 'What do you know for sure?' Oprah Winfrey began writing the 'What I Know For Sure' column in O, The Oprah Magazine. Saying that the question offered her a way to take 'stock of her life', Oprah has penned one column a month over the last 14 years, years in which she retired The Oprah Winfrey Show (the highest-rated program of its kind in history), launched her own television network, became America's only black billionaire, was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard University and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, watched friends and colleagues come and go, lost beloved pets and adopted new ones, and celebrated milestone birthdays. Throughout it all, she's continued to offer her profound and inspiring words of wisdom in her 'What I Know For Sure' column in O, The Oprah Magazine. Now, for the first time, these thoughtful gems have been revised, updated, and collected in What I Know For Sure, a beautiful book packed with insight and revelation from Oprah Winfrey. Organized by theme - joy, resilience, connection, gratitude, possibility, awe, clarity, and power - these essays offer a rare and powerful glimpse into the mind of one of the world's most extraordinary women.

Business Sutra: A Very Indian Approach to Management,Devdutt Pattanaik,205.0,836.0,205.0,836,"In this landmark book, best-selling author, leadership coach and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik shows how, despite its veneer of objectivity, modern management is rooted in Western beliefs and obsessed with accomplishing rigid objectives and increasing shareholder value. By contrast, the Indian way of doing business, as apparent in Indian mythology, but no longer seen in practice, accommodates subjectivity and diversity and offers an inclusive, more empathetic way of achieving success. Great value is placed on darshan - that is, on how we see the world and our relationship with Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Dramatised),Robert M. Pirsig,54.0,615.0,54.0,615,"James Purefoy stars in this BBC Radio 4 full-cast dramatisation of Robert M.

7 Secrets of Vishnu: The Hindu Trinity Series,Devdutt Pattanaik,114.0,501.0,115.0,501,"For Hindus, Vishnu is God, who inspires man to discover humanity by engaging with the world. Artists have visualized him with as curlyhaired, dark complexioned man with a smile on his lips and a sparkle in his eyes. Draped in yellow silk, garlanded with forest flowers, bedecked with dolphin-shaped earrings, anointed with sandal paste, he reclines on a thousand hooded serpent that floats on an ocean of milk and rides a golden hawk bearing in his arms a conchshell, a wheel, a mace and a lotus. Poets say that when he is awake, the world takes shape; when he is asleep, the world ceases to be. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, follows him wherever he goes. To him is made offerings of rich creamy butter. Sometimes, as the upright Ram, he is worshipped across India as Balaji, Shreenathji, Jagannath, Ranganath and Badrinath. Locked in the stories, symbols and rituals of Vishnu is the wisdom of the ancestors, transmitted over hundreds of years. This book attempts to unlock seven secrets that are relevant even in modern times.

Rarang Dhang: Marathi Audiobook,Prabhakar Pendharkar,,375.0,,375,"Border Roads Organization is responsible for building roads in Himalaya at huge heights, where no other country perhaps can build roads. The high altitude at such places is always challenging and tiring for machines as well as for humans. Low oxygen level, below zero temperature, eccentric nature, colossal snow piles on roads, and unpredictable landslides are few factors that affect human lives in such areas. At one side there is Himalaya & quirky nature and at another side there are diverse people with tremendous guts. You always have tussle between nature and human; likewise, you have tussle between people of different characteristics.

Titan: Inside India's Most Successful Consumer Brand,Vinay Kamath,42.0,668.0,42.0,668,"When Titan Company Limited launched its quartz watches some 30 years ago, the founders - a merry bunch of Tata employees who started out simply wanting 'to do something different' - could not have foreseen just how completely they would capture the imagination of Indian consumers in the post-liberalization era of the 1990s. The brand they created - at first against tremendous odds and restrictive norms - injected freshness into the market and in retail spaces through its cutting-edge marketing strategy and empathetic advertising. Not only did the new watchmakers on the block transform watches from being utilitarian objects to fashion statements, but it also systematically ventured into areas untapped by corporate entities with its brands Titan, Tanishq, Titan Eyeplus, Skinn and Taneira and established itself as a winner across multiple verticals. ",7 hours,",#2,834 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#487 in Business & Careers,#728 in Industries,#4,514 in Analysis & Strategy",4.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6579933583365787,0.2995975237657481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45650532512074193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5185450339891304,0.0,,0,184.8,151.8181818181818

"Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics for Non-Scientists, 2nd Edition",Richard Wolfson,5.0,1171.0,5.0,1171,"""It doesn't take an Einstein to understand modern physics,"" says Professor Wolfson at the outset of these twenty-four lectures on what may be the most important subjects in the universe: relativity and quantum physics. Both have reputations for complexity. But the basic ideas behind them are, in fact, simple and comprehensible by anyone. These dynamic and illuminating lectures begin with a brief overview of theories of physical reality starting with Aristotle and culminating in Newtonian or ""classical"" physics. After that, you'll follow along as Professor Wolfson outlines the logic that led to Einstein's profound theory of special relativity and the simple yet far-reaching insight on which it rests. With that insight in mind, you'll move on to consider Einstein's theory of general relativity and its interpretation of gravitation in terms of the curvature of space and time.

You Are the Placebo Meditation 1: Changing Two Beliefs and Perceptions,Dr. Joe Dispenza,230.0,352.0,232.0,352,"Dr. Joe Dispenza has created two meditation recordings - featuring different music - to accompany his book You Are the Placebo. In this longer 56-minute audio, Dr. Joe walks you through Meditation 1: Changing Two Beliefs and Perceptions. After introducing the open-focus technique, he then moves you into the practice of finding the present moment. When you discover the sweet spot of the present moment and you forget about yourself as the personality you have always been, you have access to other possibilities that already exist in the quantum field. That's because you are no longer connected to the same body-mind, to the same identification with the environment, and to the same predictable timeline. In the present moment, the familiar past and the future literally no longer exist, and you become pure consciousness - a thought alone. That is the moment that you can change your body, change your environment, and even create a new timeline for your life!",55 minutes,",#700 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#21 in Meditation (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#136 in Meditation (Books),#719 in Mind, Body & Spirit",4.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6494172625989449,0.21382246529312574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5961286446331995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056635298595084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2963655040503045,0.0,0.0,0.21688202303783408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,966.0,83.80952380952381

The Story of World War II,Donald L. Miller,45.0,1338.0,45.0,1338,"Drawing on previously unpublished eyewitness accounts, prizewinning historian Donald L. Miller has written what critics are calling one of the most powerful accounts of warfare ever published. Here are the horror and heroism of World War II in the words of the men who fought it, the journalists who covered it, and the civilians who were caught in its fury. Miller gives us an up-close, deeply personal view of a war that was more savagely fought - and whose outcome was in greater doubt - than one might imagine. This is the war that Americans on the home front would have read about had they had access to the previously censored testimony of the soldiers on which Miller builds his gripping narrative.

Certainly his return to St. Petersburg after years in a Swiss clinic has a dramatic effect on the beautiful Aglaia, youngest of the Epanchin daughters, and on the charismatic but willful Nastasya Filippovna. As he paints a vivid picture of Russian society, Dostoyevsky shows how principles conflict with emotions - with tragic results.

The Interpretation of Dreams,Sigmund Freud,18.0,1682.0,18.0,1682,"The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud is one of the most significant books of the 20th century. Though dreams and their role in human consciousness have been a continuing thread in religion and art and life down the centuries, Freud's look at the subject through the prism of his emerging practice and study of psychoanalysis provided a startlingly new and challenging perspective. First published in German in 1899, it sold slowly; but over the following decade he revised and expanded it in response to his experiences working with patients, reviewing his own dreams, and discussions and debates with colleagues. It was translated into numerous languages.

Three luminaries of the business world - Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest, and Mike Malone - have researched this phenomenon and documented 10 characteristics of Exponential Organizations.

"Lead with a Story: A Guide to Crafting Business Narratives That Captivate, Convince, and Inspire",Paul Smith,170.0,836.0,170.0,836,"Storytelling has come of age in the business world. Today, many of the most successful companies use storytelling as a leadership tool. At Nike, all senior executives are designated ""corporate storytellers"". 3M banned bullet points years ago and replaced them with a process of writing ""strategic narratives"". Procter & Gamble hired Hollywood directors to teach its executives storytelling techniques. Some forward-thinking business schools have even added storytelling courses to their management curriculum. The reason for this is simple: Stories have the ability to engage an audience the way logic and bullet points alone never could. Whether you are trying to communicate a vision, sell an idea, or inspire commitment, storytelling is a powerful business tool that can mean the difference between mediocre results and phenomenal success.

The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos,Brian Greene,584.0,1131.0,586.0,1131,"There was a time when “universe” meant all there is. Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different “multiverse” proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgängers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of mathematics.

Bol Bachchan [Speak Bachchan],Rupesh Dubey,5.0,668.0,5.0,668,"Author Rupesh Dubey delves into the life of Indian cinema superstar Amitabh Bachchan in this compelling compilation of incidents from his journey in cinema, dialogues from his films and lessons from his life. An inspiring and motivating audiobook, it draws success mantras from the life and work of the actor. Describing it as a self-help book, the author goes back to the early struggles of Bachchan, connecting them with our deepest aspirations. What is success, and does happiness precede or follow success? He reflects on such questions by digging deeper into the trials and tribulations of Bachchan’s rise to fame. In his conversational style, the writer cites examples from everyday life and invites the listeners to think with him, as if he were sharing his thoughts and wisdom with a friend. He points out that in Indian cinema, any film that has a star cast will easily land a producer, distributors and dates for theatrical release and even draw in the advance bookings. Similarly, happiness is a superstar, he says. Through the audiobook, he explains how we can take control of our destiny and be the producer, director and star of our own lives. Bachchan’s life provides insight into how one can persevere through hope, despair, challenges and opportunities. What can we learn from his personal journey and from his larger-than-life image on the screen?   ",5 hours and 28 minutes,",#2,438 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#22 in Biographies of Celebrities & Entertainment Professionals,#351 in Personal Success,#3,030 in Biographies & Autobiographies (Books)",5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552450670935257,0.2645360079455357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11411502493597328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14993057861351677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33367119006790413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15027851395889452,0.6585640701363462,0.0,0.14924579307766292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15861759217932514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.443755325478169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318706692224655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,25.0,133.6

And rightly so, in many ways: Even the professionals cannot agree on a single term, calling it comparative in English, compared in French, and comparing in German. The very term itself, when approached comparatively, opens up a Pandora's box of cultural differences.   ",4 hours and 56 minutes,",#3,090 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#21 in Literary History & Criticism,#379 in Linguistics (Books),#1,185 in Literary Theory, History & Criticism",4.9,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,58.800000000000004,102.24489795918366

Best of all, she’s there for you anywhere, anytime—talking you (and cheering you on) through those long nights and sometimes longer days, through crying jags, gas, and blowout diapers, nap strikes, breastfeeding struggles, stuffy noses, teething, and so much more.  ",36 hours and 47 minutes,",#409 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#2 in Parenting Infants & Toddlers,#12 in Relationships,#162 in Family & Relationships",4.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30113258136382837,0.0,0.2674805566920749,0.4331813703407088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888159767723875,0.0,0.0,0.32168951848380434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3295881545765062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946833604255104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22196484764087515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23407254184795354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28606941374267214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17615283970894527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22547259363490668,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,13714.6,355.9574468085106

The Places That Scare You: A Guide to Fearlessness in Difficult Times,Pema Chödrön,609.0,754.0,616.0,754,"We always have a choice, Pema Chödrön teaches: We can let the circumstances of our lives harden us and make us increasingly resentful and afraid, or we can let them soften us and make us kinder. Here Pema provides the tools to deal with the problems and difficulties that life throws our way. This wisdom is always available to us, she teaches, but we usually block it with habitual patterns rooted in fear. Beyond that fear lies a state of openheartedness and tenderness. This audiobook teaches us how to awaken our basic goodness and connect with others, to accept ourselves and others complete with faults and imperfections, and to stay in the present moment by seeing through the strategies of ego that cause us to resist life as it is.

Narayan’s reputation as one of the founding figures of Indian writing in English is re-examined in this comprehensive study of his fiction, which offers detailed readings of all his novels. Arguing against views that have seen Narayan as a chronicler of “authentic” Indianness, John Thieme locates his fiction in terms of its specific South Indian contexts and cultural geography and its non-Indian intertexts. The study also considers the effect that Narayan’s writing for overseas publication had on novels such as Swami and Friends, The Guide and The Man-Eater of Malgudi. ",8 hours and 42 minutes,",#2,000 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#13 in Literary History & Criticism,#19 in Indian Literature (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#747 in Literary Theory, History & Criticism",4.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583141794500049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8872377678539095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2715856008680986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2689315700876281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,105.8,145.21739130434784

"Just. You. Wait.: Patience, Contentment, and Hope for the Everyday",Tricia Lott Williford,22.0,586.0,23.0,586,"Everybody waits. We wait for a spouse, wait for a baby, wait on our children, wait for our parents. We wait for clarity and direction. We wait on a job, a promotion, a new direction. We wait for hope, for healing, and for miracles. We wait on God. And when we misunderstand what waiting is about, we can get confused about what God is up to. Waiting is one of God’s favorite tools. He can do certain things in our hearts, our lives, and our relationships while we wait - things we cannot experience once we’ve opened the gift we have been waiting for. So just you wait, because everyone takes their turn in the waiting room. It’s a long and painful fact of life, but shortcuts and microwaves aren’t the answer. God is at work behind the scenes in invisible ways you can’t see...yet. Just you wait and see how ready you’ll be if you spend your waiting well. Because when your opportunity comes, you don’t want to spend more time on the bench. When you wait well, you can say, “Look out, world: I am getting ready to shine. Just you wait.” In this audiobook, Tricia discusses the joy hidden in the discipline of waiting, and the practices of believing God is for you and working on your behalf, even when the work of His hand is hard to find. ",4 hours and 56 minutes,",#3,044 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#3 in Christian Death & Grief,#4 in Women's Christian Living,#20 in Christian Spiritual Growth",4.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25102486281430203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320570498501627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44824562083779507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21589180578865724,0.0,0.2935563469221093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22766822892090124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17133323165249167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31955762624302386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51876131480606,0.21930357853081978,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,107.80000000000001,119.59183673469387

An Introduction to Indian Philosophy,Satischandra Chatterjee,253.0,836.0,254.0,836,"The object of this book is to provide a simple introduction to the Indian systems of philosophy. Each one of these systems has had a vast and varied development. Attempt has been made to introduce the listener to the spirit and outlook of Indian philosophy and help him to grasp thoroughly the central ideas rather than acquaint him with minute details. Modern students of philosophy feel many difficulties in understanding the Indian problems and theories. Their long experience with university students has helped the authors to realise these, and they have tried to remove them as far as possible. This accounts for most of the critical discussions which could otherwise have been dispensed with.",14 hours and 31 minutes,",#2,882 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#135 in Philosophy (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#32,096 in Textbooks & Study Guides",4.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20422049405397813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26831608594425316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8957080190642606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28984066729133035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,1113.2,189.99999999999997

The Complete TurtleTrader: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires,Michael W. Covel,410.0,836.0,415.0,836,"This is the true story behind Wall Street legend Richard Dennis, his disciples, the Turtles, and the trading techniques that made them millionaires. What happens when ordinary people are taught a system to make extraordinary money? Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules. Convinced that great trading was a skill that could be taught to anyone, he made a bet with his partner and ran a classified ad in the Wall Street Journal looking for novices to train. His recruits, later known as the Turtles, had anything but traditional Wall Street backgrounds; they included a professional blackjack player, a pianist, and a fantasy game designer. For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of his money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made $100,000,000 from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend. In The Complete Turtle Trader, Michael W. Covel, best-selling author of Trend Following and managing editor of TurtleTrader.com, the leading website on the Turtles, tells their riveting story with the first ever on-the-record interviews with individual Turtles. He describes how Dennis interviewed and selected his students, details their education and experiences while working for him, and breaks down the Turtle system and rules in full. He reveals how they made astounding fortunes, and follows their lives from the original experiment to the present day. Some have grown even wealthier than ever, and include some of today's top hedge fund managers. Equally important are those who passed along their approach to a second generation of Turtles, proving that the Turtles' system truly is reproducible, and that anyone with the discipline and the desire to succeed can do as well as - or even better than - Wall Street's top hedge fund wizards. These rules worked - and still work today - for everyone.

"Mud, Sweat and Tears",Bear Grylls,928.0,683.0,932.0,683,"Bear Grylls is a man who has always sought the ultimate in adventure. Growing up on the Isle of Wight, he was taught by his father to sail and climb at an early age. As a teenager he found identity and purpose through both mountaineering and martial arts, which led the young adventurer to the foothills of the mighty Himalaya and a grandmaster's karate training camp in Japan. On returning home, he embarked upon the notoriously gruelling selection course for the British Special Forces to join 21 SAS - a journey that was to push him to the very limits of physical and mental endurance. Then, in a horrific free-fall parachuting accident, Bear broke his back in three places. It was touch and go whether he would ever walk again. However, only eighteen months later Bear became one of the youngest ever climbers to scale Everest, aged only 23.

He is a loner with few possessions by preference, but he has an indomitable spirit and an unstoppable determination for finding the truth. His father was the most decorated U.S. Marine in history, but now resides in a nursing home far from his battlefield glory. Puller’s older brother, also a military vet, is serving a life sentence in Leavenworth Penitentiary. Puller is called out to a remote, rural area far from any military outpost to investigate into the brutal murder of a family in their home. The dead husband was in the army and the wife worked for a Pentagon contractor. The local homicide detective, a woman with personal demons of her own, clashes with Puller over the investigation. What neither of them knows is what is waiting for them across the street from the murdered family’s home. It is something that will turn an already complicated case on its head. As Puller digs through deception after red herring, he realizes that absolutely nothing, and nobody, he’s so far seen in this small town, are what they seem. He is truly one man against an overwhelming force.

The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist's Guide to Success in Business and Life,Barry J. Nalebuff,317.0,949.0,321.0,949,"Game theory means rigorous strategic thinking. It’s the art of anticipating your opponent’s next moves, knowing full well that your rival is trying to do the same thing to you. Though parts of game theory involve simple common sense, much is counterintuitive, and it can only be mastered by developing a new way of seeing the world. Using a diverse array of rich case studies - from pop culture, TV, movies, sports, politics, and history - the authors show how nearly every business and personal interaction has a game-theory component to it. Mastering game theory will make you more successful in business and life, and this lively book is the key to that mastery.",17 hours and 2 minutes,",#1,456 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#7 in Mathematics (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#39 in Forecasting & Strategic Planning,#672 in Economics Books",4.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26090196844292624,0.0,0.0,0.6622126379770275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34854525556484156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25094659582989737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17296435177897318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26463518065271396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194648670954085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30960138641345636,0.0,0.0,0.25491234502664567,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,1426.5,210.88888888888889

The Ultimate Self-Discipline Library: How to Eliminate Excuses and Take Charge of Your Life!,Larry Winget,,2008.0,,2008,"Jim Whitaker, the first American to climb Mt. Everest, once said: “You can never conquer the mountain. You can only conquer yourself.” Yet, when the vast majority of people encounter obstacles to their goals, or difficulties on the journey of life, they tend to put their focus on the mountain - things that they cannot control, things outside of themselves - rather than turning inward, taking responsibility and conquering the self. That process of conquering the self is another name for that priceless quality of personality we call self-discipline. And, in this priceless collection of great ideas in sound from the world leader in personal development, Nightingale-Conant, you will be provided with all of the essential tools of self-discipline to conquer the self in every major arena of life.

Summary of the Power of Positive Thinking. A Practical Guide to Mastering the Problems of Everyday Living,Sapiens Editorial,,166.0,,166,"The Power of Positive Thinking is a work that has become a classic of the self-improvement genre. Published in 1952, it has remained relevant throughout the years. The author explains how changes in thinking processes can influence outcomes that seem otherwise inevitable. His approach, based on faith and optimism, has laid the foundation for a stream of thought structured in sound principles to achieve desired goals and achieve happiness. It is a philosophy of faith that does not ignore the problems of life, but rather is dedicated to showing a practical way to stand in the face of adversity and overcome obstacles. At one time considered a controversial book, it aroused a lot of negative criticism. In spite of this, its success has continued, and millions are still praising its ideas on the benefits of positive thinking.",27 minutes,",#3,587 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#493 in Personal Success,#7,549 in Personal Development & Self-Help",-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29644644396397524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2557609726392678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3555026139305019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24600176768696172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34511277747754854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3555026139305019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3315230801022341,0.0,0.0,0.19522870586062369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3035007830417857,0.0,0.29555591511154994,0.0,0.0,0.2946762466379391,0.0,,0,-0.0,-166.0

Now they're off to university, and Wren's decided she doesn't want to be one half of a pair any more - she wants to dance, meet boys, go to parties and let loose. It's not so easy for Cath. She's horribly shy and has always buried herself in the fan fiction she writes, where she always knows exactly what to say and can write a romance far more intense than anything she's experienced in real life.

Leadership on the Line (Revised): Staying Alive Through the Dangers of Change,Ronald A. Heifetz,88.0,820.0,90.0,820,"To lead is to live dangerously. It's romantic and exciting to think of leadership as all inspiration, decisive action, and rich rewards, but leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disrupting the status quo, and surfacing hidden conflict. And when people resist and push back, there's a strong temptation to play it safe. Those who choose to lead plunge in, take the risks, and sometimes get burned. But it doesn't have to be that way, according to renowned leadership experts Ronald Heifetz and Marty Linsky. In Leadership on the Line, they show how it's possible to make a difference without getting ""taken out"" or pushed aside. They present everyday tools that give equal weight to the dangerous work of leading change and the critical importance of personal survival. Through vivid stories from all walks of life, the authors present straightforward strategies for navigating the perilous straits of leadership. Whether you're a parent or a politician, a CEO or a community activist, this practical book shows how you can exercise leadership and survive and thrive to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

These include ""The Mirror of the Way of Strategy"", which Musashi wrote when he was in his 20s; ""Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy"", and ""Forty-two Instructions on Strategy"", which were precursors to The Book of Five Rings; and ""The Way to Be Followed Alone"", which Musashi wrote just days before his death.

Wild,Cheryl Strayed,13768.0,748.0,13808.0,748,"A powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an 1100-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe and built her back up again. At 22, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. After her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State - alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than an idea: vague, outlandish, and full of promise. But it was a promise of piecing together a life that had come undone. Strayed faces rattlesnakes and bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and intense loneliness of the trail.

How to Worry Less about Money: The School of Life,John Armstrong,61.0,323.0,61.0,323,"Break free of your destructive relationship with money, and learn how money can make you happy. Our relationship with money is one that lasts a lifetime. It can be as important as family life, as competitive as work, and as exciting and secretive as love. Yet books about money tend to take one of two routes: a) how to get more, or b) how to deal with less. This book turns these questions upside down, and looks not at money itself, but at the way we view it. How does money drive us? How does it frighten us? And how can it help us make sense of who we are?",3 hours and 14 minutes,",#1,347 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#54 in Personal Finance,#66 in Philosophy (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#309 in Personal Development",4.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25407138499608894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36059172272609846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3338129206296379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35624764067015724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33458758124193516,0.24437665052152827,0.0,0.0,0.3237647298608796,0.3368720648119429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3014958204885436,0.0,0.2936034373082019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,262.3,75.11627906976744

Brain Rules for Baby (Updated and Expanded): How to Raise a Smart and Happy Child from Zero to Five,John Medina,802.0,702.0,809.0,702,"What’s the single most important thing you can do during pregnancy? What does watching TV do to a child’s brain? What’s the best way to handle temper tantrums? Scientists know. In his New York Times best seller Brain Rules, Dr. John Medina showed us how our brains really work - and why we ought to redesign our workplaces and schools. Now, in Brain Rules for Baby, he shares what the latest science says about how to raise smart and happy children from zero to five. This book is destined to revolutionize parenting. Just one of the surprises: The best way to get your children into the college of their choice? Teach them impulse control. Brain Rules for Baby bridges the gap between what scientists know and what parents practice. Through fascinating and funny stories, Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and dad, unravels how a child’s brain develops - and what you can do to optimize it. You will view your children - and how to raise them - in a whole new light. You’ll learn: Where nature ends and nurture begins. Why men should do more household chores. What you do when emotions run hot affects how your baby turns out, because babies need to feel safe above all. TV is harmful for children under two. Your child’s ability to relate to others predicts her future math performance. Smart and happy are inseparable. Pursuing your child’s intellectual success at the expense of his happiness achieves neither. Praising effort is better than praising intelligence. The best predictor of academic performance is not IQ. It’s self-control. What you do right now - before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and through the first five years - will affect your children for the rest of their lives. Brain Rules for Baby is an indispensable guide.",9 hours and 26 minutes,",#1,459 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#7 in Parenting Infants & Toddlers,#50 in Relationships,#611 in Family & Relationships",4.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3526694618086859,0.19699658720756336,0.0,0.14090927999054473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799347154117558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19757675011664488,0.0,0.0,0.09379986006496459,0.40122369385245554,0.0,0.18556397119378365,0.0,0.0,0.18428876702249078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542035650153578,0.2858510649688636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947570959547813,0.1958610684295333,0.1958610684295333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826497531479955,0.0,0.1826497531479955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1791918815695731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33442222535885474,0.0,0.16283395689949345,0.0,0.0,0.16234931121658192,0.1958610684295333,,0,3689.2,152.60869565217394

The Power of Intention: Learning to Co-Create Your World Your Way,Dr. Wayne W. Dyer,1092.0,562.0,1101.0,562,"Intention is generally viewed as a pit bull kind of determination propelling one to succeed at all costs by never giving up on an inner picture. In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this audiobook. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has researched intention as a force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. This audiobook explores intention, not as something you do, but as an energy you're a part of. We're all intended here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first audiobook to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention.

Deng Xiaoping: A Revolutionary Life,Alexander V.

Two years after Mao's death in 1976, Deng became the de facto leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the prime architect of China's post-Mao reforms. Abandoning the Maoist socioeconomic policies he had long fervently supported, he set in motion changes that would dramatically transform China's economy, society, and position in the world.

Krabbé battles with and against each of them in turn, failing on the descents, shining on the climbs, suffering on the (false) flats.

It's an unquestioned truth of modern life: we are starved for time. With the rise of two-income families, extreme jobs, and 24/7 connectivity, life is so frenzied we can barely find time to breathe. We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or else, if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices. To get ahead at work we spend less time with our spouses. To carve out more family time, we put off getting in shape. To train for a marathon, we cut back on sleep. There has to be a better way - and Laura Vanderkam has found one.

Orientalism,Edward Said,417.0,1338.0,421.0,1338,"This landmark book, first published in 1978, remains one of the most influential books in the Social Sciences, particularly Ethnic Studies and Postcolonialism. Said is best known for describing and critiquing ""Orientalism"", which he perceived as a constellation of false assumptions underlying Western attitudes toward the East. In Orientalism Said claimed a ""subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture."" He argued that a long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia and the Middle East in Western culture had served as an implicit justification for Europe and the US' colonial and imperial ambitions.

Judgement Detox: Release the Beliefs That Hold You Back from Living a Better Life,Gabrielle Bernstein,553.0,469.0,564.0,469,"Judgement - both being judged and judging others - is at the core of our discomfort and the root of many of our life blocks. When we judge others, we get a quick hit of self-righteousness. Judgement can get us through when we feel hurt, insecure, or vulnerable. But inevitably this feeling of righteousness fades and judgement causes our energy to weaken and our thoughts to darken. Spiritual thought leader Gabrielle Bernstein made the commitment to heal her own relationship to judgement and changed her life in profound ways. She found that becoming more aware of her judgements made her a more mindful and conscious person. Her willingness to revise these perceptions has set her free. Here Gabrielle shares the process she used to liberate herself - a six-step interactive programme that calls on spiritual principles from A Course in Miracles, Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and other metaphysical and healing teachings.

Where Are the Customers' Yachts?: or A Good Hard Look at Wall Street,Fred Schwed Jr.,1.0,501.0,1.0,501,"Humorous and entertaining, this book exposes the folly and hypocrisy of Wall Street. The title refers to a story about a visitor to New York who admired the yachts of the bankers and brokers. Naively, he asked where all the customers' yachts were? Of course, none of the customers could afford yachts, even though they dutifully followed the advice of their bankers and brokers. Full of wise contrarian advice and offering a true look at the world of investing, in which brokers get rich while their customers go broke, this book continues to open the eyes of investors to the reality of Wall Street.",4 hours and 2 minutes,",#4,522 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#125 in Personal Finance,#9,428 in Personal Development & Self-Help",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6522448244904955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33078885527189633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976715804543893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31863549887078874,0.0,0.0,0.45330360147647514,,0,1.0,501.0

Why I Am Not a Christian,Bertrand Russell,303.0,1172.0,309.0,1172,"Dedicated as few men have been to the life of reason, Bertrand Russell has always been concerned with the basic questions to which religion also addresses itself - questions about man’s place in the universe and the nature of the good life, questions that involve life after death, morality, freedom, education, and sexual ethics. He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this collection perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire. ",8 hours and 1 minute,",#726 in Spirituality (Books),#831 in Theology & Philosophy of Religion,#10,440 in History (Books)",4.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37644706212627177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7531908226950864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17304500184258778,0.3504400001046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21737825312296435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016374027828661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,1333.2,266.3636363636363

But more and more, studies show that children need ""rough and tumble"" outdoor play in order to develop their sensory, motor, and executive functions. Disturbingly, a lack of movement has been shown to lead to a number of health and cognitive difficulties, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotion regulation and sensory processing issues, and aggressiveness at school recess break.

The Human Magnet Syndrome: Why We Love People Who Hurt Us,Ross Rosenberg M.Ed. LCPC CADC,520.0,668.0,526.0,668,"Since the dawn of civilization, men and women have been magnetically and irresistibly drawn together into romantic relationships, not so much by what they see, feel and think, but more by invisible forces. When individuals with healthy emotional backgrounds meet, the irresistible love force creates a sustainable, reciprocal and stable relationship. Codependents and emotional manipulators are similarly enveloped in a seductive dreamlike state; however, it will later unfold into a painful seesaw of love, pain, hope and disappointment. The soul mate of the codependent's dreams will become the emotional manipulator of their nightmares.

Alien World Order: The Reptilian Plan to Divide and Conquer the Human Race,Len Kasten,170.0,938.0,171.0,938,"Long ago, the Galactic Federation sent the Atlans, a fierce group of humans from the Pleiades, to Earth to confront the newest colony of the combative ever-spreading alien race known as the Reptilians. The ensuing battle sank the continent of Lemuria and drove the Reptilians underground beneath the Indian subcontinent as well as to Antarctica. Able to shapeshift to appear human, the Reptilians then infiltrated the Atlantean civilization, abducting humans and creating Reptilian hybrids. As Len Kasten shows, this technique of infiltration and hybridization prior to an all-out attack has been the hallmark of Reptilian conquest throughout the galaxy.

India Grows at Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong State,Gurcharan Das,40.0,879.0,40.0,879,"India's is a tale of private success and public failure. Prosperity is, indeed, spreading across the country even as governance failure pervades public life. But how could a nation become one of the world's fastest-growing economies when it's governed by a weak, ineffective state? And wouldn't it be wonderful if India also grew during the day - in other words, if public policy supported private enterprise? What India needs, Gurcharan Das argues, is a strong liberal state. Such a state would have the authority to take quick, decisive action; it would have the rule of law to ensure those actions are legitimate; and finally, it would be accountable to the people. However, India has always had a weak state and a strong society, says Das, which means that achieving something better will be an uphill struggle.",8 hours and 46 minutes,",#4,346 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#50 in Literary Essays,#1,020 in Essays (Books)",4.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309239672875309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22066412026120413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8741850802661782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588743754712983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19145286673466455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141062757426487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16138509264132228,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,176.0,199.77272727272725

No Longer Human,Osamu Dazai,585.0,586.0,594.0,586,"Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human narrates a seemingly normal life, even while he feels himself incapable of understanding human beings. Oba Yozo's attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a ""clown"" to mask his alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of human connection and tenderness.

Liespotting: Proven Techniques to Detect Deception,Pamela Meyer,398.0,703.0,398.0,703,"People - friends, family members, work colleagues, salespeople - lie to us all the time. Daily, hourly, constantly. None of us is immune, and all of us are victims. According to studies by several different researchers, most of us encounter nearly 200 lies a day.

Quite a lot, actually, and some of it isn't good for our financial health. In Your Money and Your Brain, Jason Zweig explains why smart people make stupid financial decisions - and what they can do to avoid these mistakes.

He shows why we often misunderstand risk and why we tend to be overconfident about our investment decisions.

Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crises,James Rickards,770.0,738.0,773.0,738,"In 1971, President Nixon imposed national price controls and took the United States off the gold standard, an extreme measure intended to end an ongoing currency war that had destroyed faith in the U.S. dollar. Today we are engaged in a new currency war, and this time the consequences will be far worse than those that confronted Nixon. Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries' stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence. Left unchecked, the next currency war could lead to a crisis worse than the panic of 2008.Currency wars have happened before-twice in the last century alone-and they always end badly. Time and again, paper currencies have collapsed, assets have been frozen, gold has been confiscated, and capital controls have been imposed. And the next crash is overdue. Recent headlines about the debasement of the dollar, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, and Chinese currency manipulation are all indicators of the growing conflict.As James Rickards argues in Currency Wars, this is more than just a concern for economists and investors. The United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds. Greater than any single threat is the very real danger of the collapse of the dollar itself.Baffling to many observers is the rank failure of economists to foresee or prevent the economic catastrophes of recent years. Not only have their theories failed to prevent calamity, they are making the currency wars worse. The U. S. Federal Reserve has engaged in the greatest gamble in the history of finance, a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trillion-dollar scale. Its solutions present hidden new dangers while resolving none of the current dilemmas. While the outcome of the new currency war is not yet certain, some version of the worst-case scenario is almost inevitable if U.S. and world economic leaders fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.

Everybody Writes: Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content,Ann Handley,,668.0,,668,"Finally a go-to guide to creating and publishing the kind of content that will make your business thrive. Everybody Writes is a go-to guide to attracting and retaining customers through stellar online communication, because in our content-driven world, every one of us is, in fact, a writer. If you have a web site, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers. Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt... does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary? Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring. That means you've got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well. So being able to communicate well in writing isn't just nice; it's necessity. And it's also the oft-overlooked cornerstone of nearly all our content marketing.

"The Laws of Simplicity: Design, Technology, Business, LifeDesign, Technology, Business, Life",John Maeda,108.0,469.0,110.0,469,"Finally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity. We’re rebelling against technology that’s too complicated, DVD players with too many menus, and software accompanied by 75-megabyte “read me” manuals. The iPod’s clean gadgetry has made simplicity hip. But sometimes we ﬁnd ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox: we want something that’s simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do. In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design - guidelines for needing less and actually getting more. Maeda - a professor in MIT’s Media Lab and a world-renowned graphic designer - explores the question of how we can redeﬁne the notion of “improved” so that it doesn’t always mean something more, something added on. Maeda’s ﬁrst law of simplicity is reduce. It’s not necessarily beneﬁcial to add technology features just because we can. And the features that we do have must be organized (Law 2) in a sensible hierarchy so users aren’t distracted by features and functions they don’t need. But simplicity is not less just for the sake of less. Skip ahead to Law 9: “failure: Some things can never be made simple.” Maeda’s concise guide to simplicity in the digital age shows us how this idea can be a cornerstone of organizations and their products - how it can drive both business and technology. We can learn to simplify without sacriﬁcing comfort and meaning, and we can achieve the balance described in Law 10. This law, which Maeda calls “the one,” tells us: “Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.” ",2 hours and 44 minutes,",#4,444 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Graphic Design,#7 in Industrial Engineering (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#127 in Business Careers",4.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4962248969638111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792220991948042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24965128556126623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2602861331911202,0.0,0.0,0.2574616235470212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323914321636589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24012106417786155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405604137784014,0.5566797420869526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910169708208421,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,442.79999999999995,114.39024390243904

On the Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection,Charles Darwin,131.0,2274.0,134.0,2274,"On the Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin is a work of scientific literature considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. The book introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection, backed by a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. The evidence was gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and the author’s subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Darwin’s theory that species derive from other species by a gradual evolutionary process and that the average level of each species is heightened by the “survival of the fittest” stirred controversy and opposition. Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection has become the unifying concept of the life sciences.",16 hours and 5 minutes,",#4,450 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#17 in Evolution,#21 in Biology (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1,166 in Biology Books",4.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3724347278310617,0.0,0.0,0.48795379550340323,0.3213203267376309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6181190785718277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37131592921656714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,576.4000000000001,516.8181818181818

Fear and uncertainty envelope him; between him and his achievement stand hurdles, both real and imaginary: a possible spin from the bowler can overwhelm him, his own anxiety can paralyze him, cheering fans can distract him. He needs divine intervention then. He needs to focus, get rid of all hurdles, perform, get the final run, and achieve what he so longs for. In other words, he needs to think of Ganapati. ",2 hours and 27 minutes,",#4,654 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#49 in Hinduism (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#845 in Meditation (Books),#3,035 in Hinduism (Books)",4.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42242793844537274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9063965119200273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,434.29999999999995,54.18604651162791

The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,Max Weber,129.0,702.0,130.0,702,"Max Weber's best-known and most controversial work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, first published in 1904, remains to this day powerful and fascinating. Weber's highly accessible style is just one of many reasons for his continuing popularity. The book contends that the Protestant ethic made possible and encouraged the development of capitalism in the West. Widely considered as the most informed work ever written on the social effects of advanced capitalism, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism holds its own as one of the most significant books of the 20th century. The book is one of those rare works of scholarship which no informed citizen can afford to ignore.

In an age of global threat, these emotions have become widespread and overwhelming.

The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World,David Deutsch,251.0,984.0,254.0,984,"A bold and all-embracing exploration of the nature and progress of knowledge from one of today's great thinkers. Throughout history, mankind has struggled to understand life's mysteries, from the mundane to the seemingly miraculous. In this important new book, David Deutsch, an award-winning pioneer in the field of quantum computation, argues that explanations have a fundamental place in the universe. They have unlimited scope and power to cause change, and the quest to improve them is the basic regulating principle not only of science but of all successful human endeavor. This stream of ever improving explanations has infinite reach, according to Deutsch: we are subject only to the laws of physics, and they impose no upper boundary to what we can eventually understand, control, and achieve. In his previous book, The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch describe the four deepest strands of existing knowledge-the theories of evolution, quantum physics, knowledge, and computation-arguing jointly they reveal a unified fabric of reality. In this new book, he applies that worldview to a wide range of issues and unsolved problems, from creativity and free will to the origin and future of the human species.

Coraline: An Adventure Too Weird for Words,Neil Gaiman,2897.0,292.0,2933.0,292,"Shortly after moving into an old house Coraline discovers a big, carved, brown wooden door at the far corner of the drawing room. And it is locked. Curiosity runs riot in Coraline's mind and she unlocks the door to see what lies behind it. Disappointingly, it opens onto a brick wall. Days later, after exploring the rest of the house and garden, Coraline returns to the same mysterious door and opens it again. This time, however, there is a dark hallway in front of her. Stepping inside, the place beyond has an eerie familiarity about it. The carpet and wallpaper are the same as in her flat. The picture hanging on the wall is the same. Almost. Strangest of all, her mum and dad are there too. Only they have buttons for eyes and seem more possessive than normal. It's a twisted version of her world that is familiar, and yet sinister. And matters get even more surreal for Coraline when her ""other"" parents seem reluctant to let her leave.",3 hours and 34 minutes,",            5 star,          ,            ,              80%,            ,          ",4.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5614151238037465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.564633252277735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3373230906753908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30918555025232436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3957521663858095,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,13615.9,62.12765957446808

Psychology of the Unconscious: A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido,C. G. Jung,12.0,1264.0,12.0,1264,"Published first in 1912, Psychology of the Unconscious was one of the most important stepping stones in the development of Jung’s thought and practice. It has a long subtitle: A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido. A Contribution to the History of the Evolution of Thought. This expressed the underlying impetus - a break from the view of the libido and its functions as taught by Sigmund Freud, which Jung had earlier adopted.

Purple Hibiscus,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,1562.0,938.0,1579.0,938,"Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a 2003 O Henry Prize winner, and was shortlisted for the 2002 Caine Prize for African Writing and the 2004 Orange Prize. In Purple Hibiscus, she recounts the story of a young Nigerian girl searching for freedom. Although her father is greatly respected within their community, 15-year-old Kambili knows a frighteningly strict and abusive side to this man. In many ways, she and her family lead a privileged life, but Kambili and her brother, Jaja, are often punished for failing to meet their father’s expectations. After visiting her aunt and cousins, Kambili dreams of being part of a loving family. But a military coup brings new tension to Nigeria and her home, and Kambili wonders if her dreams will ever be fulfilled. Adichie’s striking and poetic language reveals a land and a family full of strife, but fighting to survive. A rich narration by South African native Lisette Lecat perfectly complements this inspiring tale.",10 hours and 53 minutes,",#4,815 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#274 in Literary Fiction,#9,624 in Contemporary Fiction (Books)",4.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7993947552985676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15573972754654306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887685462887401,0.0,0.18058596507933802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520657861769192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904365322592743,0.0,0.0,0.2617198748753923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289411978452255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0,7185.2,203.91304347826087

And for countless readers, On Becoming a Leader has served as a beacon of insight, delving into the qualities that define leadership, the people who exemplify it, and the strategies that anyone can apply to achieve it. In a world increasingly defined by turbulence and uncertainty, the call to leadership is more urgent than ever.

The Name of the Rose,Umberto Eco,803.0,1139.0,810.0,1139,"This hugely engaging story of murder, superstition, religious politics and drama in a medieval monastery was one of the most striking novels to appear in the 1980s. The Name of the Rose is a thrilling story enriched with period detail and laced with tongue-in-cheek allusions to fictional characters, the most striking of which is the Franciscan friar William of Baskerville, who displays many characteristics of Sherlock Holmes. Although he looks at the past through a postmodern lens, Eco catapults his listeners into the dark medieval world as Brother William tries to discover why people are dying inexplicably and nastily in the monastery. There is something not altogether right within the library that is the pride of the establishment....

Inferno: From The Divine Comedy,Heathcote Williams,867.0,501.0,872.0,501,"""Abandon all hope you who enter here."" (""Lasciate ogne speranza voi ch’intrate."") Dante’s Hell is one of the most remarkable visions in Western literature. An allegory for his and future ages, it is, at the same time, an account of terrifying realism. Passing under a lintel emblazoned with these frightening words, the poet is led down into the depths by Virgil and shown those doomed to suffer eternal torment for vices exhibited and sins committed on earth.

Machine Learning: The New AI: The MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series,Ethem Alpaydi,96.0,586.0,96.0,586,"Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition - as well as some we don't yet use every day, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as ""Big Data"" has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning - the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge - has also advanced.

The Founder's Mentality: How to Overcome the Predictable Crises of Growth,James Allen,126.0,668.0,128.0,668,"Why is profitable growth so hard to achieve and sustain? Most executives manage their companies as if the solution to that problem lies in the external environment - find an attractive market, formulate the right strategy, win new customers. But when Bain & Company's Chris Zook and James Allen (authors of the best-selling Profit from the Core) researched this question, they found that when companies fail to achieve their growth targets, 90 percent of the time the root causes are internal, not external - increasing distance from the front lines, loss of accountability, proliferating processes and bureaucracy, to name only a few. What's more, companies experience a set of predictable internal crises, at predictable stages, as they grow. Even for healthy companies, these crises, if not managed properly, stifle the ability to grow further - and can actively lead to decline.

Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond,Gene Kranz,626.0,1289.0,630.0,1289,"Gene Kranz was present at the creation of America's manned space program and was a key player in it for three decades. As a flight director in NASA's Mission Control, Kranz witnessed firsthand the making of history. He participated in the space program from the early days of the Mercury program to the last Apollo mission, and beyond. He endured the disastrous first years when rockets blew up and the United States seemed to fall further behind the Soviet Union in the space race. He helped to launch Alan Shepard and John Glenn, then assumed the flight director's role in the Gemini program, which he guided to fruition. With his teammates, he accepted the challenge to carry out President John F. Kennedy's commitment to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s.

The Signature of All Things,Elizabeth Gilbert,3803.0,1054.0,3809.0,1054,"Elizabeth Gilbert’s first novel in twelve years is an extraordinary story of botany, exploration and desire, spanning across much of the 19th century. This audiobook follows the fortunes of the brilliant Alma Whittaker (daughter of a bold and charismatic botanical explorer) as she comes into her own within the world of plants and science. As Alma’s careful studies of moss take her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, the man she loves draws her in the opposite direction into the realm of the spiritual, the divine and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose is a Utopian artist. But what unites this couple is a shared passion for knowing, a desperate need to understand the workings of this world, and the mechanism behind of all life. The Signature of All Things is a big novel, about a big century. Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, this story soars across the globe, from London, to Peru, to Philadelphia, to Tahiti, to Amsterdam and beyond. It is told in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time. Alma Whittaker is a witness to history, as well as maker of history herself. She stands on the cusp of the modern, with one foot still in the Enlightened Age, and she is certain to be loved by listeners across the world.

Fever Dream,Lincoln Child,534.0,500.0,537.0,500,"At the old family manse in Louisiana, Special Agent Pendergast is putting to rest long-ignored possessions reminiscent of his wife Helen's tragic death, only to make a stunning - and dreadful - discovery.

Creating Great Choices: A Leader's Guide to Integrative Thinking,Jennifer Riel,35.0,703.0,35.0,703,"A practical four-step methodology for any leader or manager facing a tough choice, and for creating integrative solutions to big, complex, and pressing problems. Conventional wisdom - and business school curricula - teaches us that making trade-offs is inevitable when it comes to hard choices. But sometimes, accepting the obvious trade-off just isn't good enough: the choices in front of us don't get us what we need. In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and better answer. This is integrative thinking. First introduced by Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation. Now, in Creating Great Choices, Martin and fellow Rotman expert Jennifer Riel vividly show how they have refined and enhanced the understanding and practice of integrative thinking through their work teaching the concept and its principles to business and nonprofit executives, MBA students, even kids. Integrative thinking has been embraced by organizations such as Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, Verizon, and the Toronto District School Board - all seeking a replicable, thoughtful approach to creating a ""third and better way"" to make important choices in the face of unacceptable trade-offs. The book includes new stories of successful integrative thinkers that will demystify the process of creative problem solving. It lays out the authors' practical four-step methodology, which can be applied in virtually any context: ",-1,-1,4.7,0.11512699685887481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4603397419361697,0.0,0.1646377292793233,0.0,0.0,0.4178779702862159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23513685988853267,0.0,0.0,0.23743977263027025,0.2173195217369948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23084773053822588,0.0,0.0,0.10959530819297568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10914619883134231,0.0,0.22819371929266072,0.0,0.1114886884844669,0.33398701811341286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21340709862212578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025793104215441,0.0,0.0,0.1953686648860689,0.0,0.19025441699296677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1,1,164.5,149.5744680851064

Considered one of the greatest, The Importance of Being Earnest is a farce, playing with love, religion, and truth as it tells the tale of two men, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, who bend the truth in order to add excitement to their lives. Jack invents an imaginary brother, Ernest, whom he uses as an excuse to escape from his dull country home and gallivant in town. Meanwhile, Algernon follows Jack's scam, but his imaginary friend, Bumbury, provides a convenient method of adventuring in the country. However, their deceptions eventually cross paths, resulting in a series of crises that threaten to spoil their romantic pursuits.

"Eastern Body, Western Mind: Psychology and the Chakra System as a Path to the Self",Anodea Judith,743.0,1172.0,752.0,1172,"In Eastern Body, Western Mind, chakra authority Anodea Judith has brought a fresh approach to the yoga-based Eastern chakra system, adapting it to the Western framework of Jungian psychology, somatic therapy, childhood developmental theory, and metaphysics. This groundbreaking work in transpersonal psychology has been revised and redesigned for a more accessible presentation. Arranged schematically, the book uses the inherent structure of the chakra system as a map upon which to chart our Western understanding of individual development. Each chapter focuses on a single chakra, starting with a description of its characteristics, then exploring its particular childhood developmental patterns, traumas and abuses, and how to heal and maintain balance. Illuminated with personal anecdotes and case studies, Eastern Body, Western Mind seamlessly merges the East and West, science and philosophy, and psychology and spirituality into a compelling interpretation of the chakra system and its relevance for Westerners today.

St Urbain's Horseman,Mordecai Richler,6.0,836.0,6.0,836,"St. Urbain’s Horseman is a complex, moving, and wonderfully comic evocation of a generation consumed with guilt - guilt at not joining every battle, at not healing every wound. Thirty-seven-year-old Jake Hersh is a film director of modest success, a faithful husband, and a man in disgrace. His alter ego is his cousin Joey, a legend in their childhood neighbourhood in Montreal. Nazi-hunter, adventurer, and hero of the Spanish Civil War, Joey is the avenging horseman of Jake’s impotent dreams. When Jake becomes embroiled in a scandalous trial in London, England, he puts his own unadventurous life on trial as well, finding it desperately wanting as he steadfastly longs for the Horseman’s glorious return.

What Works: Gender Equality by Design,Iris Bohnet,55.0,1172.0,56.0,1172,"Gender equality is a moral and a business imperative. But unconscious bias holds us back, and de-biasing people’s minds has proven to be difficult and expensive. Diversity training programs have had limited success, and individual effort alone often invites backlash. Behavioral design offers a new solution. By de-biasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big impacts. Presenting research-based solutions, Iris Bohnet hands us the tools we need to move the needle in classrooms and boardrooms, in hiring and promotion, benefiting businesses, governments, and the lives of millions. What Works is built on new insights into the human mind. It draws on data collected by companies, universities, and governments in Australia, India, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, Zambia, and other countries, often in randomized controlled trials. It points out dozens of evidence-based interventions that could be adopted right now and demonstrates how research is addressing gender bias, improving lives and performance. What Works shows what more can be done - often at shockingly low cost and surprisingly high speed.",-1,-1,4.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27056449377356934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2891632398798643,0.0,0.28208122791620055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5576605906742433,0.0,0.14133832426669843,0.0,0.2954983154552922,0.0,0.14437171952672315,0.43249481862327427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24711133125331755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27635045497533023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1,1,258.5,249.36170212765956

Infinite Awareness: The Awakening of a Scientific Mind,Marjorie Hines Woollacott,28.0,836.0,28.0,836,"As a neuroscientist, Marjorie Woollacott had no doubts that the brain was a purely physical entity controlled by chemicals and electrical pulses. When she experimented with meditation for the first time, however, her entire world changed. Woollacott's journey through years of meditation has made her question the reality she built her career upon and has forced her to ask what human consciousness really is. Infinite Awareness pairs Woollacott's research as a neuroscientist with her self-revelations about the mind's spiritual power. Between the scientific and spiritual worlds, she breaks open the definition of human consciousness to investigate the existence of a nonphysical and infinitely powerful mind.

Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle,Dervla Murphy,167.0,633.0,167.0,633,"Full Tilt is the inspiring true story of Dervla Murphy's 1963 journey from Ireland to India on an Armstrong Cadet bicycle, and the trials, landscapes, and cultures she encountered along the way. The route takes her through the valleys and snowy mountain passes of Europe and India to the scorching deserts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the metal of her bicycle, Rozinante (named after Don Quixote's steed), becomes too hot to touch. She travels alone, without luxuries, sleeping on the floors of teahouses or on blankets outdoors, vulnerable to wild animals, insects, and thieves. However, she is often met with generosity and kindness, and shares many meaningful encounters with the locals. Her portrayal here gives a fascinating insight into the unique communities of the Middle East in the early 1960s. ",-1,-1,4.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4133701341149962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7658985374452991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35293250485524535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434577260413632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-1,1,784.9,134.68085106382978
